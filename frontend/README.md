# Useless Monitor Frontend

A single-page Vite + React experience that renders an interstellar operations console with a bilingual user interface, animated
starfield backdrop, and live-updating telemetry widgets. The dashboard now consumes real HTTP probe data generated by the backend,
so manual status toggling is gone—each card reflects the response code, latency, and last contact timestamp reported by the API.

## Features
- **System integrity dashboard** with animated progress indicator and bilingual labels (English/Chinese).
- **Service grid** showing latency, uptime, status chip, HTTP code, and endpoint per subsystem.
- **Terminal-style event stream** that continuously emits randomized INFO/WARN/CRIT events with auto-scroll controls.
- **Language toggle** that switches every on-screen label between English and Chinese without reloading.
- **Admin editor** that lets you add or update monitors by specifying the name, sector/type, and monitored URL (the backend handles
  the actual HTTP checks).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+

### Installation
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts Vite in development mode. Open the printed local URL to explore the dashboard.

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs an optimized bundle to `dist/`.

## Configuration
Create `public/config.json` so the dashboard knows how to reach the backend API. A starter file is available at
`public/config.example.json`:

```json
{
  "apiBase": "http://localhost:8080",
  "readKey": "YOUR_READ_KEY"
}
```

- `apiBase`: The base URL of the UselessMonitor backend (for example `https://monitor.example.com`).
- `readKey`: The `READ_KEY` value configured on the backend; it will be sent as the `Authorization` header for every request. When
  an admin key is supplied through the login modal, it is used automatically for write operations.

Copy the example file, update the values, and restart Vite:

```bash
cp public/config.example.json public/config.json
# edit public/config.json and insert your keys
npm run dev
```

The frontend will continuously fetch `/monitor` for card data and `/status` for the global indicator from the configured backend at
runtime.
